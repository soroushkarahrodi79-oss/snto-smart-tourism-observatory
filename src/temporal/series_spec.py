"""
SNTO — Temporal Series Specification (F2 scaffolding)
=====================================================
Canonical, declarative definition of a multi-year satellite time series.

This module does NOT fetch data. It defines *what* series the observatory
intends to build (territory, year span, cadence, tile, indices, quality
floor) so that ingestion, the Mann-Kendall validity gate (``trend_gate``) and
the provenance manifest (``manifest``) all agree on the same plan and the same
set of expected periods.

The 5-year PNSG plan (``PNSG_5Y``) is the reference series the project is
structuring toward: monthly Sentinel-2 composites 2021–2026. Until that series
is actually ingested via Google Earth Engine, this spec is the contract the
rest of the temporal layer is written against.
